The code found here replaces "passwd.c" in openldap2.4.40/libraries/liblutil/.
The code relies on the ersatz library in order to compile. The goal is to 
create an ldap server that authenticates users with valid passwords and triggers
alarms if a ersatz password is used. Currently, the library logs an event if a
ersatz password is used. You can find a place holder in "passwd.c" to trigger
alarms, messages, or anything else. 

Building
1. Copy Makefile and passwd.c to the openldap2.4.40 liblutil directory:
cp openldap2.4.40/libraries/liblutil/Makefile Makefile.bak
cp openldap2.4.40/libraries/liblutil/passwd.c passwd.c.bak
cp Makefile openldap2.4.40/libraries/liblutil/
cp passwd.c openldap2.4.40/libraries/liblutil/

2. Copy ersatz.c, ersatz.h, and ersatz_words.h to the openldap2.4.40 liblutil
   directory
cp ersatz.* openldap2.4.40/libraries/liblutil/ 
cp ersatz_words.h openldap2.4.40/libraries/liblutil/ 

3. Run make in openldap2.4.40/libraries/liblutil/ and verify that it builds
4. Run make and make install in openldap2.4.40.

Testing
Run the following command and type 123 as the password to see the library is
working correctly:
slappasswd -h \{CRYPT\} -c '$6$%.16s'
You sould see:
{CRYPT}$6$o1O2cizjqfK2qLmU$7v1ErC7vcSWMbCqnO3.hNc8l8/Ejr7y9FNmCCJsEpfwOGinuGhdUUxVnNZ5A2qVdMIy7dKj9e9VRbvQMwh7NL
If you dont, make sure you built the ersatz library with the RANDOM_ERSATZ_WORD set to 0 to fix the ersatz password to "ersatz".

Usage
1. write/replace the following lines in  slapd.conf: 
pssword-hash {CRYPT}
password-crypt-salt-format "$6$%.16s"
This will tell slapd the correct hash/salt format. 

2. write/replace the following in ldap.conf
pam_passwd crypt

3. Create an ldap user with a hash generated with slappasswd as shown above. See
example_user.dif for an example.

4. On an LDAP client machine, log in with user created in step 3 using the
ersatz password.

5. On the LDAP server, view /var/log/auth.log. You should see an entry indicating that a user tried to log in with an ersatz password.
